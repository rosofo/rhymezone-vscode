# Rhymezone Extension for VSCode

Why would anyone do this?

I write my lyrics in markdown files! It's a format I'm comfortable with, and it means I can make things like this to improve my process.

## Usage

Open the command palette and run 'Rhymezone: Lookup Word'. You'll get a tree of rhymes and synonyms for the word under your cursor. If you move your cursor around the tree will update. Simple as that.
